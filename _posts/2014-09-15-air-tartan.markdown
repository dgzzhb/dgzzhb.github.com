description: This game was the winner of "Audience Choice" at iOS App Challenge at CMU. iOS App Challenge at CMU was hold by Apple Inc. between September 25 to 29 at Carnegie Mellon University. As the product manager and main developer of the team, I led the team to build the entire project over one weekend using Agile Methodology and Git. The underlaying technology is Swift and SpriteKit which the team members learned right before the Hackathon. There are three key features we are very proud of, Motion control, One-click share, and Physical engine.
