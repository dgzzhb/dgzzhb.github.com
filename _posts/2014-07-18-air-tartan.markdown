This game was the winner of "Audience Choice" at iOS App Challenge at CMU. iOS App Challenge at CMU was hold by Apple Inc. between September 25 - 29 at Carnegie Mellon University.

The game tells a story of Scotty on an adventure to several top tier schools around the country. What inspired us is our passion for our university and our love for Scotty. The game is more oriented to members of the CMU community. However, anyone that loves having fun should give it a try. There are three key features we are very proud of. 1) Motion control. Scotty goes the direction which the user tilt the device toward. 2) One-click share. The user can share their feelings about our app with his or her friends on social websites, without even leave our Game. It takes only a simple tap on the screen. 3) Physical engine. The collision and aviation system is built on real physical world, which makes more sense for users.
