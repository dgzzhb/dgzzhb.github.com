<p>CS315 Project Proposal</p>
<p>Tian Zheng</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I am going to make a website for a student organization called LDSSA, which stands for Latter-day Saints Student Association. And I will meet four milestones during the project.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>First, I am going to use HTML and CSS to make a static website. The main contents of the website should be done this way. Like the introduction of the organization, member list, resource downloads, and contact information. These pages will be the 'framework' of my site. I think it is easier to deliver these materials just using HTML and CSS rather than using more complex technologies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After I have enough knowledge to work with PHP, I will try to add some dynamic contents into my site. At first I thought about some forms that users could fill in and submit. Then I decide to save them for future when we need to work with database. So my plan is to add something called 'Daily Scripture' in my website: everyday there will be a quote from scripture displayed on the homepage. And this will be done using PHP.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since I didn't choose to do form submission in the last part, my JavaScript cannot be something like data validation anymore. At this moment I am thinking to do an online bible history calendar with JavaScript, it will be a calendar, but when you click some specific years, you can see something big happened in the Bible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the last step I will do a member system using PHP+MySQL. There will be register, login, forget password, comment and contact us functions. All the dynamic functions will be using PHP and the data will be saved in MySQL.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At this point, I think the time and space complexity of my project fits well for this course. Please let me know if you have any other concerns about my project. Thank you!</p>
